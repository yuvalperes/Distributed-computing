This program implements the repeated majority protocol for distributed computing (population protocol model).
There are n nodes, each having an initial belief (a bit in {0, 1}). The goal is that after running some 
distributed protocol each node has the correct initial belief with high probability. Relevant parameters are 
the amount of memory that each node has, the time to consensus, the amount of communication used.

System dynamics: each node keeps track of a state which is either 0, 1, or ?. 
Initially each node has state 0 or 1. In each round, a node gets selected uniformly at random and 
is matched with a random other node. The nodes that get matched exchange state and update their own state 
based on this communication. The repeated majority protocol works as follows:

  Let U, V, and S represent, respectively, the set of nodes storing 0, 1, and ?
    --> If a  node in U (resp. V) contacts a node in U, S (resp. V, S), then it does not update its value. 
    --> If a node in U (resp. V) contacts a node in V (resp. U), it updates its value to ? (resp. ?).  
    --> If a  node in S contacts a node in U (resp. V), then it updates itâ€™s value to 1 (resp. 0).
